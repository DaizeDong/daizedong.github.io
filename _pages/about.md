I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://www.rutgers.edu/new-brunswick), advised by [Prof. Hongyi Wang](https://hwang595.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).
My research focuses on improving the efficiency of neural networks across algorithmic and system levels. Specifically, I am interested in the following areas:

1. Efficient Architectures: Mixture of Experts, Sparse Activation Models.
2. Model Compression: Pruning, Quantization.
3. High-Performance Computation: System Optimization, Efficient Kernels.
