Machine Learning Principles (01:198:461, Sec. 06) surveys core ML foundations: linear/logistic regression, regularization, decision trees/forests, probabilistic models, kernels/SVMs, and an introduction to deep learning (CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, Transformers).

[//]: # (As the TA, I lead the weekly recitation to clarify key concepts and derivations, work through examples and short exercises, hold office hours, and provide practical guidance on assignments and quiz preparation in coordination with Prof. Bernhard Firner.)
